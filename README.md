# Python Space Invaders

## Overview

I created this Python Space Invaders game as a fun project. The game is built using the Pygame library. I initially learned the basics from a tutorial on game development in Pygame, which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWpgLFMI7w&t=2500s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org). However, I added various features and modifications to make the game unique.

## Features

- **Sound Effects and Music:** Added copyright-free sound effects and background music to enhance the gaming experience.
- **Player Controls:** Enabled both arrow keys and A/D keys for movement, providing flexibility to players.
- **Optimizations:** Implemented optimizations, such as avoiding unnecessary screen redraws and limiting the frame rate for consistent performance across different devices.
- **Pause Menu:** Added a pause menu with options to adjust music and sound volumes, resume the game, or exit.
- **Scoring System:** Implemented a scoring system with killstreaks, providing an extra layer of challenge.
