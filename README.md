# Python-Space-Invaders
I made a Python Space Invaders game for fun

I was bored with my CS125 intro to programming class so I learned how make a game in pygame. 
I watched a tutorial on game making in pygame to learn new features https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWpgLFMI7w&t=2500s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org 
I felt the project wasn't my own so I added things not in the tutorial. 

I added sound effects and music (copyright free) 
I made both arrow keys and a/d work which took a lot of work 
I added optimizations such as not redrawing a black screen then background as I only redrew the background every frame. 
I added a pause menu with a button to exit the game
And other things
